Abstract
=============================================================

One of the most unregarded topics in the area of OWL-S is the top down
approach of generating the WSDL Grounding. This tool generates WSDL
service descriptions for given OWL-S atomic process signatures.
In particular, the translation of an atomic OWL-S service process signature
requires the translation of parameter types defined in OWL-DL.

The semi-automatic OWLS2WSDL tool converts referenced OWL concepts to
XML Schema types. Respectively generated data structures for each
OWL class may vary depending on the chosen configuration of the
integrated XML Schema generator. 

OWLS2WSDL has been used to generate the groundings of OWL-S
services in the test collection OWLS-TC2 in WSDL.
